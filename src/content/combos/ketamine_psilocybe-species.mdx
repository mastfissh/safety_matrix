## Experience reports

"exponentially more intense than either substance on its own, probably more intense even than if I had doubled the doses" [Bluelight] (https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/psilocybin-ketamine.928479/).

"My glow in the dark stars that I placed around my room's light in a spiral shape were all spinning around, swirling around, and smiling at me. I felt free. I felt like things were getting off my chest. I started forgiving everybody for everything they've ever done to me" [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=35465).
