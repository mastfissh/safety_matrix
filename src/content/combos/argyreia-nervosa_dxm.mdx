## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

“everything is getting more intense by the minute. I needed to put my earbuds down. I wanted to experience pure silence. What a feeling. I need to emphasise here that this trip is not just beautiful. It is painful as well, but I realised that this is exactly what I needed to experience.” [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=116498).
