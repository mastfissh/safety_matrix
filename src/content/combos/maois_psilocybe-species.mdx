## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

"definitely alters and lengthens the effects of the mushrooms, but overall I didn't find it much more powerful, just different. It made the visual effects more dramatic and pronounced and gave the trip a grounded feel. It also brought out the creepy side of the mushrooms moreso than usual, but at the same time I felt emotionally disconnected to some extent which made it easier to handle." [Bluelight](https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/combo-subthread-mushrooms-maois.293629/page-2).

"it multiplied the intensity of the shrooms 4-5x. I am not the same person I was yesterday." [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=81480).
