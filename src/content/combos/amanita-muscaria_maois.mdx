## Experience reports

“I had been experimenting with B. caapi and Syrian Rue of late… I wanted to see if adding a mushroom would enhance the feeling, it did… I felt great during the practice, but when I was leaving, I started having 'glitches' in time. It seemed that time was standing still. As I got home, I noticed my vision was switching from near to far and back and forth, and I was seeing flame-like visions with the changes. I thought it was something like deja vu, one eye registering in short term memory and the other in long term. Then I thought it was my left eye vision registering in my right brain and vice versa, so I closed one eye and to my dismay it was still happening…” [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=41049).
