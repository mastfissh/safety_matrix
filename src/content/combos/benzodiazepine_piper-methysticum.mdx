## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination
"I like the combo of kava extract and benzos. They certainly do potentiate each other. However, I find real benzos like xanax far superior to kava. The combo might be a little dangerous for someone with absolutely no tolerance to benzo" [Bluelight](https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/xanax-vs-kava-or-combine-them.590912/).
