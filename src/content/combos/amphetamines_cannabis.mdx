## Experience reports

“I was too dizzy to sit up and my head felt indescribably shaken and delirious, so I laid down and closed my eyes. I felt the typical pot symptoms at first, but they were insanely magnified. My sense of perception was way off and it felt like time was moving slowly.” [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=66827).

“I lost all of my memory. All of it. I began to pace. This was probably an automatic physical response, not a conscious one at all. I was acting on muscle memory alone. For a while I didn’t know who I was, where I was, I had no idea what was going on” [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=53933).

“Mentally and physically, the trip was feeling incredibly similar to rolling, with a slightly more psychedelic edge (I was experiencing slight perceptional disturbances such as blurring of figures, objects drifting in and out of focus, and colors appearing much more vivid).” [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=79035).
