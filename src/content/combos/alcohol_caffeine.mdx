## Experience reports

“I felt very sick, my stomach feeling like fire.I was twitching like crazy and everything was so distorted I thought I was loosing my mind. I tryed laying down but I just kept moving everywhere and even t.v. didnt seem to do much but make me wanna move. Every time I got up to try to do anything I'd feel even more nausous. After about 2 hours the alcohol didn't feel present but the caffeine was definantly making my heart go faster then I could handle” [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=78169).
