## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination
“I had the strangest auditory hallucinations, as if someone was speaking on a PA system, and the laughter around me was in echoed unison. Every sound had a lazer like quality to it, and the music beats were so deep and peircing. It was defintely sensory overload.

It was impossible to move, to say anything, to comprehend what people were saying to me ... I was in a different dimension. I managed to get myself to the bathroom, which was an adventure of its own, and the bathroom wasn't even 10 feet away. I looked insane on the bathrroom mirror..seriuosly like a cartoon caracter, something fantastical from Shrek or the cat in the hat...THESE were visuals...Everything was strobing, with tracers, it was impossible to focus on anything. There are so few words to describe what was happening in my mind at the time...” [Erowid](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=32112).
