## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

“i have used amphetamine while taking paxil (paroxetine) and it greatly increased the effects. It about doubled the duration, probably because of its strong cyp2d6 inhibiting properties” [Bluelight](https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/prozac-effect-on-amphetamines.845068/).

“Sertraline 100mg (Zoloft, an SSRI like Prozac) during methamphetamine abuse causes no apparent problems. If anything, the sertraline actually helps with the darker side of meth… fluoxetine is a major inhibitor of cyp2D6, and amphetamine is a substrate. This might make any meth or amph more potent.” [Bluelight](https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/stimulants-and-prozac.834881/)
