## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

"Taking an opiate does tend to reduce the power of the trip slightly, but only because the opiate euphoria makes you feel distanced from it. The trip still continues on. Although, depending on the substance, the visual activity will sometimes be reduced." [Bluelight](https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/combo-subthread-lsd-opiates.289956/).
