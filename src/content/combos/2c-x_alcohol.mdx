## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

“The combination is physically safe, though many do not find it desirable (and some of us do). If you do drink while tripping, be careful because alcohol will not affect you as much as usual, and it's easy to go overboard, also be sure to stay hydrated.” [Bluelight](https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/2c-b-and-alcohol.559973/).
