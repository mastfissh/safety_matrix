## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

"I was instantly slammed into a completely black and empty world as if someone had put a bag over my head and beat me senseless. I saw short bursts of bright white light above me and I felt like thousands of volts of electricity were passing through my brain." [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=18493).

"I could now only hear my song, and let me tell you, it was the most beautiful thing I have, to this day, ever heard. The echo and chorus on it sounded like it was digitally pumped up 200%. I was suddenly concious of my slowing breathing until it stopped. I have never passed out before from a drug, and I believe this is what I did. The colors I saw after the black faded were incrediable. Blues, reds, oranges, purples and whites (purple and red dominated the vision) spun around in a wonderful ballet" [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=6640).
