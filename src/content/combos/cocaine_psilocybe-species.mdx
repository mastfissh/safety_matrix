## Experience reports

"my heart is beating fast, I feel fine, bullet-proof, paranoid, sketchy. But I'm having a lot of fun, this drug is very different to Pot, and Mush and ecstasy and hallucinogens. It isn't a funny drug really. It didn't make me giggle. It gave me courage, strength, speed, and more. All in all it was a lot of fun." [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=9594).

"my heart was beating a million times a minute and i thought i was going to die cause i had no clue what shroom and coke where like while mixed. the walls where bending inward to me" [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=25126).
