## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

“The fractals on my computer screen expanded and filled the room around me, occupying the entirety of my vision. I no longer registered the existence of my body, all I knew was I was moving through a wonderland of geometric shapes. I began to feel as though I was in another world.” [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=115989).

“I coughed and within one second I was tripping harder than I ever had before. To my surprise me being drunk did not affect my trip and the DMT completely overpowered the alcohol.” [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=76713).
