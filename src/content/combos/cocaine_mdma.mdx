## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

"if cocaine is done before /during mdma, it blocks the mdma from opening up the SERT I believe. basically it can prevent you from rolling at all. plus it would just crack you out and make you feel speedy and not all smooth like x alone." [Bluelight] (https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/coke-and-mdma.777337/).

"Cocaine and MDMA together is a bad idea - mixing stimulants can be dangerous. Not to mention, the coke will kill your roll." [Bluelight] (https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/molly-and-cocaine.638180/).
