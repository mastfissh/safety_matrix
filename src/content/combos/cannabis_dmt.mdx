## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

"I could not move, I was immobilized and confronted by an entity or energy so malevolent it scared the living shit out of me." [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=116415).

"I saw a giant neon spider-like being from the inside out. I was in its multi-bladdered heart, moving outwards through its body. It communed with me, and taught me to surrender... a phenomenal mood for about an hour afterwards, I am filled with energy and want to sing and dance." [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=19626).
