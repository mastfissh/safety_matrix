## Experience reports

“This trip was never very intense. The visual hallucinations were mild but beautiful patterns covering everything. Walls breathed and colors were heightened but I did not see entities and people's faces did not distort.” [Erowid](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=9218).
“Most adequetly described, the expierence was like having butterflies in my stomach, but some ravenous meat eating strain of butterflies. Marijuana mellowed me out. But overall, coming up I was quite nervous and anxious and this seemed to be the root of my stomach irritation.” [Erowid](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=27081).
