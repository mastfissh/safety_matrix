## Experience reports

“…expected amazing visuals, and did not really get them. The LSD visuals remained dominant. 2C-B did take some of the edge off of the body load (LSD makes my shoulders feel like they're stapled to my ears sometimes). Stretching was very easy and felt incredible. Music appreciation was classic LSD, but the 2C-B added an extra layer of joy…” [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=95945).
“When I am extremely high on LSD it is hard for me to differentiate between the two highs but they definitely create nice synergy. I definitely enjoy this combination in lower doses” [Bluelight](https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/combo-subthread-lsd-2c-b.392958/page-4).
