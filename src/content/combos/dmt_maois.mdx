## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

"from out of the sea of colours there was a blast of pure love that shot through me. I knew exactly what it was, as if I had known my whole life but chose to ignore it. It was creation itself. I had a huge grin on my face. I was truly properly happy for the first time in years." [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=109084).

"First, the onset of the trip was extremely rapid (less than 15 minutes). Second, there were extreme and persistent auditory hallucinations that would characterize the first 90 minutes of the trip... Then there were more common aspects which should be noted up front - extreme open/closed eye visuals, separation from body and mind, trouble focusing on tasks, vomiting, gas, etc." [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=115854).
