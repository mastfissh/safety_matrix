## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination
"i don't think they potentiate - they just increase sedation, and of course, respiratory depression - which is why it is so dangerous. it's a very risky thing to go chasing recreational kicks from. personally i'd recommend avoiding mixing benzos with opiates" [Bluelight](https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/do-benzos-potentiate-opiates-at-all.857633/).

" Whenever I take benzos while high on opiates, it dulls my buzz and puts a blanket over it and totally such a waste of opiate get high time and money" [Bluelight](https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/in-what-order-should-i-take-my-drugs-benzos-opioids.873495/).
