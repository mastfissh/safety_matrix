## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

“2C-B and K was unique. 2C-E and K was less so. It intensified the visuals and the confusion and the tripping by an enormous factor, which was kinda fun for 20 minutes at a time if I really wanted to push it.” [Bluelight](https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/combo-subthread-ketamine-2c-x.374074/page-3).
