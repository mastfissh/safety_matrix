## Experience reports

"The feeling of being at the peak of a rollercoaster just as it began its descent was dominant. The second hit initiated a “dissolving” of the scene I was overlooking (which was roughly the top half being the sky, and the lower half being the ocean)—with small fractals exploding, spinning, and buzzing out of the horizon where ocean and sky met." [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=89948).
