## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

"mushrooms seem to combine well with Salvia. It seems to come just a bit more gradually, in a less intense fashion, but the effects seem to last longer, with a lingering physical buzz. The effects are also quite pleasant, which is also quite different to smoking Salvia when sober-smoked this way it is always interesting, but definitely not pleasant, for me anyway. The boost in the visuals is noticeable and effects the mushroom trip for quite some time afterwards." [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=68794).
