## Experience reports

"Cocaine is a CYP2D6 inhibitor which is responsible for DXM to DXO conversion IIRC. I think you would be risking overdosing on DXM as well as getting hypertensive crisis from cocaine (or the combination) and cocaine also has serotonergic effects (although perhaps most of that is reuptake inhibition) and that is I think also to generally be avoided with DXM." [Bluelight] (https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/dxm-subthread-cocaine.662838/).

"I experienced a strange "teleportation" by which I would black out only to become lucid upon doing a line. Basically I would suddenly appear in a different part of the room having done another line which brought me back to reality." [Erowid] (https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/cocaine-and-dxm-a-dangerous-mix.511051/).
