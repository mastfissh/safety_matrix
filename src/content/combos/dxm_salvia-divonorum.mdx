## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

"To this day I have flashbacks that Iâ€™m stuck in loops and I have to change my thought pattern or I get stuck... Just imagine a high pitched whirring sound slowly taking over your mind then shattering your ego and putting you into a death time loop that can only be described as Hell." [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=74874).

"I am convinced the Salvia and DXM combination showed me the consciousness of infancy. It was as earth shattering as it was beautiful." [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=10137).
