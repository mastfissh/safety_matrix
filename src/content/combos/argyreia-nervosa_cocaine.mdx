## Experience reports

“When we are dancing I can't help but feel weird. I feel the normal affect of the LSA, plus the coke, but I have a weird feeling like my heart is under pressure (Hard to explain). Also I realize that my fingers are feeling numb. I knew I was not dehydrated because I was making sure to drink plenty of water and I wasn't even sweating from dancing.” [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=93227).
