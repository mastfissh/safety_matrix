## Experience reports

"Not a twinge of anxiety whatsoever, even though I should have been freaking out that my roommate knew I was on some drug." [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=77434).

"NO anxiety at all. Not even a single TRACE. I just leaned back in my chair, with music playing LOUD, my arms splayed out on the desk in front of me, the muscles soft and not wanting to move. Totally enjoying the pot instead of the chest tightness and fleeting worry." [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=26496).
