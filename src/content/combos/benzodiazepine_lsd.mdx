## Experience reports
"people talk about keeping benzos "on hand" etc etc while tripping, but i say if youre an inexperienced tripper or even first timer, just take your benzos with the tabs, and supplement dose a few hours later, this will put you in a nice relaxed head space, something kinda hard to do if youre a newbie tripper."
