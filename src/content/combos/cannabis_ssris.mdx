## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

"After Prozac I get moderately intoxicated, very unmotivated and only slightly tired. Visual scrolling, time dilation, closed-eye visuals and other psychedelic effects are greatly reduced. Almost no increase in emotions, and little euphoria. There's a new effect in that I feel pressure in my head. I feel as if it's made me stoned and stupid rather than high and mind expanding. There also seems to be more hangover (bad short-term memory, lethargy, lack of motivation) than before." [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=78469).

"Overall, I felt pretty normal afterwards, and havenâ€™t experienced any mix reactions with the daily 60 mg of fluoxetine." [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=84321).
