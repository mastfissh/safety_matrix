## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

"these drugs have a cumulative effect greater than either alone. This combination is definitely in the big-leagues of ego-dissolution, introspection and transformation." [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=88999).

"I have had plenty of entity contacts in the disembodied domain of DMT, but this thing tangibly coexisted in the same physical spacetime matrix as my body and the rest of consensus reality, which is a new one on me! I am really baffled as to how to interpret and integrate this" [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=2013).
