## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

"Felt waaaay fucked up in a fun way for a brief period of time. Then I layed down on the roof I was hanging out on and passed out. I was awakened about 1/2 hour later and as I stood up and went inside, the nausea hit. I ran downstairs to the bathroom, barfed up a tiny amount (I hadn't really eaten that day or I'm sure more would have come up) and then I passed out for 3 hours on the bathroom floor."
