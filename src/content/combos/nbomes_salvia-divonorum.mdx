## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

" I remember seeing this vast network of kaleidoscopic eyes, a galaxy of sorts, very bright yellow, and swirling away into infinity. Well, that's it folks. I never really tripped within a trip before, but it is very unnerving, intense, and a bit frightening. Beware. This combination was very powerful." [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=111636).
