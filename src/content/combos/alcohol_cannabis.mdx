## Experience reports

“My body was no longer controlled by my head, and my head was lost under water, very deep down. Although I never actually lost consciousness I could feel my head slipping away from me. The next thing I knew was that I was vomiting all over myself… [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=81778).

“The simple task of focusing became literally impossible… My perception of depth became completely compromised, as objects in my retinas were always closer than they appeared.” [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=23052).
