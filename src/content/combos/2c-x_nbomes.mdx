## Experience reports

“I was sitting in the passenger's seat of my car and I started seizing and vomiting uncontrollably. It was so bad that my buddy almost called 911. The only thing I could see was fuzzy visuals like a broken TV picture and I had no control of my body. After about 2 hours of sitting and drinking a gallon of water I was able to get out of the car and walk over to a bush to pee. My vision came back” [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=116207).
