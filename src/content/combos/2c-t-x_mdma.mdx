## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

“i'm chewing some gum and clenching really bad. sleep is nowhere in sight. i get up and walk around in the dark for a while. i have distinct open-eye-visuals. those are cool. lots of red lasers shooting around. there were some auditory hallucinations as well. every sound was amplified at least 5 times. i couldn't lay still. every time i would lie down i would find myself kicking my legs around. i would tell myself to calm down but it was not working. my thoughts made no sense and i was starting to freak out. i would bounce back and forth from my front room to my bedroom trying to fall asleep but to no avail.” [Erowid](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=4486).
