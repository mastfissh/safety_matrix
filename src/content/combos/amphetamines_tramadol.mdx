title: Amphetamines + Tramadol
---
## Experience reports

“Tramadol (Ultram) is well-known for its propensity to lower the seizure threshold, especially in dosages higher than 300mg in a single sitting. Likewise, Amphetamines and essentially, all stimulants that act in a similar fashion also will lower the seizure threshold. Sure, if you are responsible and use reasonably low dosages of each drug, I'd wager that you will be fine. However, I'm filing this one under "not advised, proceed at your own risk"” [Bluelight] (https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/tramadol-how-dangerous-w-speed.903317/).
