## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

"I am uncertain if I will ever blaze up on DMT while jacked up on acid, it being rather intense. There was a sense of loss when I came off the DMT and back to acid reality...  I feel the only way I got through the let down of coming back to acid reality after the such vivid insights the DMT gave me was because I had a sense that even though it was over, I had fulfilled my purpose of self inspection." [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=41279).

"it was challenging and weirder than anything I have ever experienced, but it was intense and unforgettable in a good way." [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=92381).
