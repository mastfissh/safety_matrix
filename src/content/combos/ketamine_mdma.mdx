## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

"The MDMA adds a lovely positive vibe to the K which can feel a bit cold and alien to me used alone sometimes. I also agree that small bumps are better whilst the MDMA is at its peak and nice big lines are better on the comedown." [Bluelight] (https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/combo-subthread-ketamine-mdma.400228/).

"I feel an extreme body load, I lay down again, put headphones on and start putting on some experimental music, from this point it is a little difficult to explain, I could feel my body extremely sedated, my vision getting distorted and the music I was listening to was even more intricate" [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=113166).
