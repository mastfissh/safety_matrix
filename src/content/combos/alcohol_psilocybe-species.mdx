## Experience reports

“I was dehydrated from shrooming, drinking, and dancing despite drinking 3-4 cups of water right before going to the rave and drinking two water bottles at the venue. From that point on I couldn't dance because at every attempt I felt sick again.” [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=110394).

“When I drank alcohol during a mushroom trip, I found that everything seemed extremely funny. However, it lessened the profundity of the experience and made me feel much more "dumb." If you're just tripping for fun, then alcohol may lessen the anxiety associated with tripping and also heighten the euphoria.” [Bluelight] (https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/combo-subthread-mushrooms-alcohol.175676/).
