## Experience reports

"I began to feel a slight tingling and calm spread through me, at the same time, ever stronger waves of intense euphoria hit me again and again, I noticed quite a strong itch, which strangely enough wasn't unpleasant... I felt sort of like in a pleasant sleepy trance, with my eyes half open, just utterly numbed out bliss, with amazingly pleasant, relaxed waking dreams" [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=43574).

"This combo definitely produces an after-effect the following day. I have just returned from a lunch meeting and I must say that I felt dulled-out and ever-so-slightly detached the entire time. It is liked the most intense weed hangover I have ever experienced." [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=94222).
