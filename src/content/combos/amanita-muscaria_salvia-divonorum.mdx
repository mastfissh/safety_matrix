## Experience reports

“the most horrific experience of my life. I found myself caught in a neverending loop of thought… I felt I was in some sort of hell, destined to experience this loop forever.” [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=25539).

“I'd been pretty far out; couldn't even remember my name. I tried and tried, but it was a bizarre sort of trying, as if the name was trying to get to me. It seemed to be calling out from a great depth, but I just couldn't grab on to it. No idea of normal reality. I could not have responded in any way if spoken to. There was no fear at all. Last time I was that far out on salvia alone, on a much higher dose, I was terrified. This time I just sat and waited. Amanitas have quite a strong anxiolytic effect on me… [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=30259).
