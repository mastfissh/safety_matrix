## Experience reports

“Then the nausea set in, this is probably the only thing about ayahuasca that can be a little tricky but it wasn't too bad, I felt like throwing up a few times but suprisingly after about 10 to 15 minutes that all cleared up rather nicely.” [Erowid] (<https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=49332>). 

“…I saw that objects had begun to send ripples through the air from their edges, like rocks being thrown into a pond. My sense of time was greatly distorted, and I had a sense of euphoria wash over me… as I looked at my sitter, she had what almost looked like transluscent multicolored face paint on that disappeared when I blinked and reformed. [Erowid] (<https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=101111>).
