## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

“When I use Adderall by itself, especially in large doses, the soaring, euphoric stimulation is accompanied by uncomfortable effects such as muscle tension, perhaps a little trembling or difficulty taking deep breaths, sensations of bodily weakness, nervousness, etc. Xanax COMPLETELY eliminates these effects” [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=18396).

“Benzos are really good to have a round for the amphetamine comedown. I've been on prescribed benzos and amphetamines before, the amphetamine euphoria was lessened by the benzos in my case. That being said the amphetamine induced anxiety was eliminated and for me that was huge!” [Bluelight](https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/mixing-benzos-with-amphetamines.756711/).
