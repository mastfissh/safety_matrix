## Experience reports

"Kratom and opiods didn't mix well. Instead of "helping" they kinda hindered each other. Others may have some joy by mixing or using in the same dosing day; just didn't do anything for me.
I would use the kratom after depleting my opies" [Bluelight] (https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/oxycodone-and-kratom.878647/).
