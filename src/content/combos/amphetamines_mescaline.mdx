## Experience reports

“The biggest downside of this combo is the comedown. I'm not only getting the comedown from MDMA but also the comedown from speed. The two comedowns mixed are brutal” [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=100413)

“the dextroamphetamine took away a bit of the empathy, connected, lovey feelings from MDMA… the music and physical sensation was awesome, being able to mentally zone into a track and demolish it with energetic dancing with such mental clarity that dextroamphetamine allowed for was very enjoyable. I didn't get literally as lost in the song as I do normally with MDMA.” [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=116427).
