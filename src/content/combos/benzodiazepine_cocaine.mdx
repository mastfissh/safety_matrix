## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination
"I was able to have a very life changing conversation with a friend of mine, which I've saved for further inspection. Though I suspect the mixture of cocaine and xanax led me to being so open and the friend reciprocating, I give at least 90 percent credit to the xanax."
