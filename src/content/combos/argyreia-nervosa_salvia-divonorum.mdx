## Experience reports

“This pattern would sometimes morph into designs of words, patterns, and faces that would morph back into the pentagonal pattern. During this journey if I at times gained enough will power and self recognition that I could open my eyes, I would pop back into the car, but the real world was just as distorted as the Salvia realm so I would go back there for a while.” [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=4634).

“A vision of my infused form with the pusher entity was seen in a out of body experience like view. It is hard to explain what its appearance was. I can most closely relate it to a catapillar and a train and colorful images on its body and spirals around its aura. The vision lasted for a while, but slowly but surely was fading away and slowly but surely I realized I was looking at my living room.” [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=88889).
