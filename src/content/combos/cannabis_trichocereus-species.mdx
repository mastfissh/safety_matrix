## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

"I knew that I needed to go lie down because I was leaving reality. I felt this sensation like I was moving at a very high speed I looked up at the stars and they were spinning around in the sky then falling like shooting stars. Everything started to strobe in bright fluorescent colors then morph into rainbows." [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=99542).

"I see what people mean when they say mescaline is weak when it comes to combos, I could definitely feel some weed in there with the tripping." [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=98817).
