## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

"I think it works well both ways. E after shrooms gives you a wicked body buzz, and tends to make the mindfuck better (for me, anyway). Shrooms after E can give you some really cool visuals." [Bluelight](https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/combo-subthread-mushrooms-mdma-the-hippyflip.463238/).

"I enjoyed watching the colors of water change from green to blue into undecribable other colors... By this time, anything that came out of my mouth was not necessarily what I was thinking, as my mind had separated into three different minds. One was my own, which pretty much sat in the back and observed, one was spiritual and was taking in all the sacredness of what was around, and the other was the obnoxious inexperienced foulmouth who now had control over everything I was saying." [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=47019).
