## Experience reports

“Wow. That was the most intense dog walk I have ever been on. The gardens were so beautiful. It's spring time here in California and the flowers are so fragant and colorful. My dog was wonderful. She was, and is, my guide through this part of my trip. She charged ahead, and I gripped the leash and flew behind her like a kite.” [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=23986).
