## Experience reports

"I think it makes the experience more vague and strange but also more interesting than ketamine on it's own. It's like ketamine tends to be a little typical in it's monochromatic (grey-scale) visionary meta-thinking ways and cannabis adds some color to this" [Bluelight] (https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/combo-subthread-ketamine-cannabis.630498/).

"For a first try of this combo, I wouldn't hit any weed while you're still re-dosing and/or coming up on the k -- wait until you're as high as you're going to be on the ketamine. If you're comfortable with that level of high, having a good time, comfortable in your environment, etc, then it'll most likely be groovy. If any of these variables is off, I'd put the peace pipe down until you're coming down, bearing in mind that smoking on the comedown also has the potential revive peak effects of the ketamine."
