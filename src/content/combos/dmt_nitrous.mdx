## Experience reports

"For lack of a better description, I find the nitrous smooths out the DMT experience considerably. Some of the more intense physical effects of the DMT are tempered, like the heaviness in the chest, the sometimes overwhelming rushy feel, the shortness of breath. These all seem to be rendered rather inconsequential with the addition of the nitrous. Itâ€™s hard to feel the body load when there is no real sense of having a body. Visually it is more intense than DMT alone. The usual kaleidoscoping fractals, clown images and flashing lights explode in a fury of incomprehensible madness, as if moving into a fourth dimension. Sound, colour and shape become almost indistinguishable, blending together in perfect synethesia... tendency for the nitrous to prolong the effects of the DMT. The linear curve of the comedown was much longer, with visuals still being present up to a half hour later." [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=66034).
