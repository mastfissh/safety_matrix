## Experience reports

"An entity was there and I was filled with the conviction that it was God, but it was so alien and frightening that I felt a sense of despair. The only way I can describe it is that it was like an enormous insectoid wheel (with spokes) that was slowly turning...  Felt a profound sense of peace and calm, and a kind of inner congratulation that I had learned something I needed to know." [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=101407).
