## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

“the 5-meo-dipt had smoothly sailed into my personal world, effortlessly combining it's own brand of intense physical energy with the mood lift that was already rolling through me from the 2c-t-2. I felt great. I danced, I shook, I let my limbs be taken over by the bass.” [Erowid](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=6111).
