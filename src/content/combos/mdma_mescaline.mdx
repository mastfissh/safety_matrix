title: MDMA + Mescaline

## Experience reports

"The combined effects of mescaline and MDMA were incredible. It was like a typical mescaline trip, but with all the MDMA-like qualities dramatically enhanced. The mescaline also seemed to buffer the MDMA come-on, making it more gentle and gradual, with the two drugs melding their effects into a warm, fuzzy trip. It felt really really good. It was also a very deep trip..." [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=2373).
