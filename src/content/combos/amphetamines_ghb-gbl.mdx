## Experience reports

“I decide to drink 4G of GHB dissolved in soda, aiming to pass out. Normally this would force me to sleep. I felt like I was crashing from the addys. But even after long it had worn off I couldn't sleep. So I drank 2G more of G to induce a slumber. Last thing I remember was being at a vending machine downstairs, and throwing up shortly after.” [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=113633).

“GHB is such a powerful depressant, that it seems to always have precedence over the stimulant. Definitely be careful, even though a stimulant sort of fixes the issues most people have with GHB's dosing curve, it's still very easy to go overboard” [Erowid] (https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/do-stims-and-ghb-mix-nicely.658510/).
