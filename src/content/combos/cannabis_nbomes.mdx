## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

"I notice that the OEV are getting more intense now, obviously because of the cannabis. The tips of the grass seem to dance when I stare at them, and after 10 seconds of staring a swirly circle has superimposed itself on top of my vision, making the blades of grass swirl as well." [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=110315).

"Halfway through smoking I stare up at the sky to see a kaleidoscope of stars spinning and twinkling in the night sky." [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=100405).
