## Experience reports

"As the world came back into focus, it was as if I was within a Picasso painting. The wall directly across from me, being a two dimensional image on the page of a book, for instance, in a sober state of mind, immediately leaped out of the page into three dimensional existence. The wall gained depth by promptly becoming many walls, at least three, each having a slightly different distance from me, but all in the same position at the same time." [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=23350).

"We both started to get auditory hallucinations of some sort of humming all around us as if their was a UFO hovering above us and I turned around and saw the face of an alien entity on an aspen tree that was staring at me." [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=87683).
