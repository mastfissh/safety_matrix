## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

"mild rushes of energy, a distinctive but not strong entactogenic effect (feeling affectionate, kissing, etc)... The candyflip effect was not really there, so it looked like mephedrone did not have the strong LSD interlace ability that mdma has." [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=86995).
