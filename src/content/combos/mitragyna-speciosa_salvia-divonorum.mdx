## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

"Suddenly, the world in front of me started breaking up into what looked liked puzzle pieces. At this point I started merging with everything and getting strong kaleidoscopic visuals in my peripheral vision. Suddenly, I felt like I was pulled back and I was looking at the sky. Apparently my body, which I was no longer in control of, had decided to lie down." [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=116546).
