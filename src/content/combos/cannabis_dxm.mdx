## Experience reports

"We dediced to smoke a joint, and this mellowed us both out. While puffing the roach, I suddenly felt myself drifing away from my body, like my mind was being lifted out of my head. I felt cold and light, and I could tell I was moving away from any kind of high I'd ever felt before." [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=7156).

"Marijuana and DXM are a perfect mix. A low dose can be catapulted up a couple plateaus for a little while, and a high dose can shoot me into oblivion." [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=8139).
