## Experience reports

“…I saw that objects had begun to send ripples through the air from their edges, like rocks being thrown into a pond. My sense of time was greatly distorted, and I had a sense of euphoria wash over me… as I looked at my sitter, she had what almost looked like transluscent multicolored face paint on that disappeared when I blinked and reformed. [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=101111).

“…I remember through sobs saying that I just wanted it out of me and I wanted it to be done, referring to the pain and loathing, and at this point I vomited what little was in my stomach.” [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=101421).
