## Experience reports

“I continued to vomit, and between vomiting, had extremely vivid closed eye hallucinations…” [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=73962).

“Starting to feel dizzy, certainly no pain as the stoned feeling made me forget that my foot hurt. Even if my foot hurt I think I could just grin and bear it at this point. Very heavy sweating. I was pouring sweat so badly that my hair was stuck to my head, shirt soaked, sweat getting in my eyes. Had to keep a towel handy. Also started to notice problems urinating as when I needed to go it was just very slow…” [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=80011).
