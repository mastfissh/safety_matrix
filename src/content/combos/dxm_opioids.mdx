## Experience reports

"I think recreational doses of DXM and an opiate would be a bad idea. Codeine even worse - I know DXM releases a large amount of histamine (at least it did / does in me - I was itching like crazy for hours - I took ~750mg my one and only time). You may also end up too dissociated to realize you're having respiratory issues which could be fatal at worst." [Bluelight] (https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/dxm-opiates.612220/).

"i love mixing low doses of DXM with opiates... if you just want to potentiate and not get much of a DXM feel, go for 30-60mgs before you take your opiate dose. however, increasing the dose to 90-150 gives a nice, speedy buzz that synergizes with opiates well IMO" [Bluelight] (https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/using-dxm-to-pontentiate-opiates-questions.649704/).
