## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

"inside the umbrella was a room that I was allowed to see, full of sacred objects and mystical geometry of great importance. All of this well on an assembly line at Santa's workshop. There where millions of elves working at a million work stations, all with important jobs. As the elves kept moving me from room to room, showing me all the artifacts in the psychedelic museum." [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=95855).
