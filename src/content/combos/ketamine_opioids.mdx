## Experience reports

"In moderation it isn't particularly unsafe, but aside from pain relief, I personally feel it is a waste of opioids (especially good opioids, like oxycodone). Dissociatives blunt opioids in my experience." [Bluelight] (https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/ketamine-opioids.924504/)
