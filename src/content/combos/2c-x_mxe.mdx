## Experience reports

“I don't get anywhere near the same sort of transformative I-became-other-objects experiences that I do mixing 2c-*s with K. I think it's largely because with MXE I tend to feel like I'm still receiving more imput from my peripheral nervous system so I still have the image of my body-map online and I don't fully dissociate into mental representation. I also think that's why I tend to have more motor coordination with MXE than K.” [Bluelight](https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/combo-subthread-2c-b-dissociatives.398834/).
