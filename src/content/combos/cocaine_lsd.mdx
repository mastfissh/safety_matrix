## Experience reports

"I felt like I was dying. My body felt like it was crushed and soaked with blood, as though I had been in a bad accident, and I could even taste blood in my mouth. I believed I was at a hospital, receiving treatment for this accident I was in. I was so scared by the thought of my death that even called 911 and my home and everyone on my contacts list trying to get help. J took the phone from me so I wouldn't say anything I'd regret and I felt so helpless." [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=56920).
