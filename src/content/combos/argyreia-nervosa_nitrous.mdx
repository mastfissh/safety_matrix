## Experience reports

“I felt like I was a candle, and instead of lowering myself to the ground, I was simply melting, becoming a puddle of wax on the linoleum. The cupboard door I sat back against grabbed me like a magnet and I was just struck with the complete opposite of weightlessness. I was terrified of what had just entered my mind, but in a state of ecstacy in the same exact moment.” [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=29665).

“my eternal soul had left my body and was to never return. It goes against rational thought but at the time seemed so real and very, very scary to say the least. Before I finally managed to fall asleep I convinced myself that this was it. I had gone insane and was never going to be sane again.” [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=101872).
