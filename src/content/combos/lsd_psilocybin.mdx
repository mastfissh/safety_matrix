## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

"We had become one, a perfect union of soul and body. The sex that night was the best of my entire life... At times, I felt as though I would end up a conspiracy theorist, forced to live on the streets on a cardboard box." [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=49064).

"you really can't distinguish between the two substances, since by themselves they are so similiar anyway" [Bluelight](https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/combo-thread-lsd-mushrooms.339690/).
