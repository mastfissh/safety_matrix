## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

“I assume that the alcohol altered the course of the experience because I had never achieved such dramatic results from only one inhalation of the extract. Upon taking the one hit I was thrown into a dissociated state that resembled effects from three separate levels of Salvia experience. The effects from the alcohol were most likely felt regarding the trips amnesic effects.” [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=13137).

“What happened inside my head is something I can barely explain. I went to some far off distant world. I had no concept of the reality I've known for most of my life. All of my senses were overwhelmed with new and different things that I had never experienced before. My vision zoomed rapidly from one intense sight to another. Unfortunately I don't think any description can do justice to what I experienced… I'm pretty sure that the intensity of this experience was related to all of the alcohol I had consumed.” [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=25182).
