## Experience reports

"...for the most commonly prescribed SSRI antidepressants today, the effect upon enzyme activity is actually quite minor. There are some SSRI's that were known to have a pretty serious effect upon certain Opioids (re: Fluvoxamine -> Methadone), but the aforementioned drug has been discontinued for the most part, with one of the reasons being that it did have the potential to screw with other prescription medications. This drug is still available, but not commonly prescribed for obvious reasons." [Bluelight] (https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/is-morphine-opium-affected-by-ssris-snris.862619/).

"I've taken both Effexor & Wellbutrin at high doses & neither affected my opiate use/its effects (hydrocodone & oxycodone at the time)." [Bluelight] (https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/is-morphine-opium-affected-by-ssris-snris.862619/).
