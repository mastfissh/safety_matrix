## Experience reports

“Generally when I take the adderall by its self I become very focused at one task at a time, but now I am very flighty with my every action. I can’t decide what to do and as soon as I pick something up I move onto something else… my speech was very rapid. I was also jumping from one subject to another, paying no real attention to anything she had to say.” [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=60336).

“The adderall/vyvance causes me to want to do work and study; the caffeine, while it doesn't affect that urge, prevents me from being able to concentrate when I sit down to work because of the jitters.” [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=85359).
