## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

“…It couldn't have been more than 30 minutes before I eventually drifted off. And thus began the craziest dreams I ever had… The last thing I remember of the dream was all the frogs turning to look at me. Hundreds of eyes of trippy little frogs staring right at me. I still felt amazing but was beginning to get scared at how many were just staring at me. And then they all jumped on me. All at once. Hundreds of frogs covered every inch of my body. The euphoria was too much. To the point it was almost unpleasant…” [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=109587).
