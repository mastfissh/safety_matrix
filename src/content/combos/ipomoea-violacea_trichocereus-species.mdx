## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

"I began to hear trees, birds, bugs, etc talking to me and comforting my soul. It was not a sharp feeling like I normally assiociate with acid, the mescaline definantly smoothed it completely out, and in turn the MG strengthened the trip. I sat outside and felt completely in harmony with all the universe. I realized that problems I had recently (depression/anger/confusion from 2 very shitty years in a row) been having were because I let the mundane insignifigant stuff pile up on top of the inner joy that everyone posseses" [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=26803).
