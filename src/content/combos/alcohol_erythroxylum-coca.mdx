## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

“Definitely a good high. Far more subtle than snorting cocaine, and at the same time still intense. A very smooth up, a very steady high and a very smooth comedown… goose bumps, elevated body temperature and heart rate were also present.” [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=51792).

“Just about the perfect stimulant...energy without jitters, mood lift without a big crash...” [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=60621).
