## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

"I threw up very voliently, and after approx 15 mins of throwing up, I felt way better, and the visual effect suddenly came up into my visions slowly getting stronger and stronger, it was unexplainable, it was very odd, had a lot of 'mental chat' with some sort of god, and that 'spirit' I was talking to was 'guiding' giving me insights into my life, and I was sort of in dream state, but with my eyes open...very strange but interesting experience."
