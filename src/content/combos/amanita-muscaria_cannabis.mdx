## Experience reports

“We woke on the rocks, exponentially deeper into the trip than when we’d fallen asleep…  We got back to the car, which is subsequently when I was overpowered by the substance, and thrown into what I can only describe as an infinite loop.” [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=107768).

“objects were starting to look different and I felt really really drunk and high at the same time.. I left the shed and felt paranoid that my neighbours would see me in the state I was in, I walked back to my backdoor looking at the floor which was shifting and spinning also I could slow down and speed music and up with my mind in my head…” [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=114817).
