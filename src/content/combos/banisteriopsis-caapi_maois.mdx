## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination
"My other experiences with the same batch of herbs at the same dose interval were quite mind-opening and valuable even without addition of moclobemide. So far I have found moclobemide a bad admixture to the brew that dimms valuable emotional colors." [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=54934).
