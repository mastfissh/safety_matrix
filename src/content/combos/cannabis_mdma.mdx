## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

"My edible cannabis + mdma combinations usually require a lot less of both substances to get kicking, smoking the potentiation is milder, but still noticable." [Blluelight](https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/weed-mdma.891893/).

"Physically it is reasonably safe. It can make your roll feel very different. I find it makes me feel less empathy, more paranoia and more "headfucked" MDMA has a real clarity and I think pot dulls that :( I would recommend you save weed for the comedown, it's nicer separately."
