## Experience reports

“you'll probably need to reduce your doses of both to prevent yourself becoming unpleasantly over-stimulated. There's also the issue that some feel the cocaine can blunt the effects you might normally expect from adderall, making the experience less enjoyable.” [Bluelight] (https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/mixing-cocaine-adderall.879601/).

“I was expecting the cocaine to supplement my Adderall high, if not altogether blow my mind with more intense euphoria than I could imagine. Instead, this was the most anti-climactic, disappointing experience I can remember, more lame than the final episode of last season's 'The O.C.' or the final Seinfeld episode. I came down, albeit gently” [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=36189).
