## Experience reports

"I take the Kava about 30-45 minutes before smoking in a little juice, then fire up. It gives you such a nice buzz and you feel really just totally relaxed and pleasant. One subtle side effect is that you may really want to sleep about 3 hours after" [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=9536).

"The sum of them together is much greater than their parts. They totally enhance each other and make for a great time." [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=6310).
