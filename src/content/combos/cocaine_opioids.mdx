## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

"The danger with mixing opiates and strong stimulants is that if you take them at the same time you might take too much of one. Then when the one with the shortest duration wears off you will either be dangerously overstimulated or dangerously sedated." [Bluelight] (https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/cocaine-opiates.836160/).

"As long as your tolerance is at the proper level for those doses, then no. There is no inherent negative interaction between opiates and cocaine, the only risk is overdose." [Bluelight] (https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/opioid-cocaine-together.717492/).
