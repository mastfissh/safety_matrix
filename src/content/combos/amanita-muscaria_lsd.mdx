## Experience reports

“…The grass seemed to move around in a spiraling fashion changing to brilliant colors of red, blue, and yellow… The time passed quickly and i returned home for a meal with my mom. The plate and food were as indistinguishable as her words but i struggled and went to my room after dinner. the world went black as I laid down and visions of all kinds started. i lost time then and was brought to consciousness again 2 hours later…” [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=371).

“I looked down at my feet and was amazed to see that they were miles away from the rest of me, I then looked around and everything was big and small at the same time” [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=73903).
