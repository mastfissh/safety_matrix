## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

"a good overall body and mental high, less stimulation than meph on its own by far and less horniness. More body pleasure. Same amount of teeth grinding. No headache like I often get whilst on stimulants: the codeine must have seen to this." [Bluelight](https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/mephedrone-codeine-mini-speedball.617471/).
