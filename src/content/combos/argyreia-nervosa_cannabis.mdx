## Experience reports

“Everything was happening, though almost nothing was happening. I curled up in the toilet bowl, and felt completely drained. Everything went black. I woke up in a fetal position in front of the sink in the bathroom.” [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=96652).

“definitely heightened the feelings of euphoria and wellbeing with the music and the orange glow from the sunset sounding and looking more beautiful than ever before.” [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=92833).
