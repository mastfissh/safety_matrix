title: Alcohol + Piper methysticum

## Experience reports

“I felt extremely sedated and euphoric. I felt and still feel very happy. I’m surprised at the effects because 8 grams in tea have never felt this potent. This is something I’d definitely try with a little alcohol again. It’s much nicer than being drunk, and very potent at the same time…” [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=57399).
