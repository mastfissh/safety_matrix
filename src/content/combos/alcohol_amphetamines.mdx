## Experience reports

“All of a sudden; I felt awake and clear. I became more of an extrovert than I’d ever been in my life. Considering all the alcohol consumption that had occurred (and ended minutes prior); I was suddenly totally sober.” [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=74968).

“I completely blacked out, I cannot remember a thing until being back at my home around 05:30 with all my friends. They informed me that I had walked round in circles in the club all night telling them that there was no time to stop when they approached me to talk. Anyway I was still completly buzzing, although my legs felt really tired.” [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=33103).
