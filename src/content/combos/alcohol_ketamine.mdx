## Experience reports

“At first I felt like the world was at my feet - for about 3 minutes. Then I started to feel queasy, so took a trip to the ol' toilets with a friend. I did not realise I was in a toilet but thought I was in a spinning like open white space. I. threw up. I curled in to ball, thought I was going to die, could not move and wept.” [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=93602).

“I retched, right onto the mostly-white rug, and slid off the couch, with my face in my own cherry-colored vomit… I was so high from the questionable combination of ketamine on top of a bigger-than-I-had-thought alcohol buzz, that I felt firmly pinned to the floor and was not too conscious of what was happening.” [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=9640).
