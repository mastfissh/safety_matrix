title: Amanita muscaria + Nitrous

## Experience reports

“When I combine nitrous oxide with psychedelics, it takes me to a dissociative void, but at the same time I have all of these mystical thoughts about infinity and impossible logic and what have you. Even though it is in itself a state of mindlessness, there are still all kinds of thoughts floating around, even if they don't make a whole lot of sense. With the Amanita pantherina and a full dose of nitrous, there was none of that... or anything, for that matter. I was still, on some level, feeling my body; I was anesthetized strongly, but not completely.” [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=105110).
