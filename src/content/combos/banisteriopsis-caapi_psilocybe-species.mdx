## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination
"For the next four hours I was pinned to my bed and unable to move. During this time my astral body was being 'kneaded' by some unseen force as though it were made of play dough." [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=47268).

"...how different caapi with mushrooms was from syrian rue with mushrooms. I had taken dosages of up to 3 grams of syrian rue with 2 grams of mushrooms, and never had as powerful and spiritual an experience as this. Also, I had never noticed much nausea with syrian rue, whereas caapi made me purge" [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=57698).
