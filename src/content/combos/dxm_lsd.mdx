## Experience reports

"LSD and ketamine is one of the most devastating combinations to take for your sense of reality and ego, from what I hear LSD and DXM also has serious potential though for everone considering this: first make sure you react well to DXM and like it because there is a big deviation regarding appreciation. That is true for dissociatives in general but for apparent pharmadynamical reasons for DXM doubly so." [Bluelight] (https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/combo-subthread-lsd-dxm.617964/).

"These dxm+LSD trips have been some of the most intense experiences Ive had in all my (almost 20) years of tripping. Sometimes difficult." [Bluelight] (https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/dxm-and-lsd.907677/).
