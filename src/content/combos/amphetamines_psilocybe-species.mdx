## Experience reports

“the Adderall definitely made me more talkative and added a bit of aggressiveness to the trip… we both felt like we stopped tripping after a couple hours, but I think we just focused on the speedy aspect once we started climbing, even though the mushrooms were definitely still working” [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=26865).
