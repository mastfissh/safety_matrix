title: Amanita muscaria + MDMA

## Experience reports

“the mdma is making us want to sleep, which is very odd, I had done mdma once before and the last thing I wanted to do was sleep, it was the same feeling as the first time only not as strong, and it had a sedative effect to it for both of us, possibly because of the amanitas we had previously ingested… I feel very very uncomfortable, feelings I had never had before nor ever wanted were rampant. I felt a recurring feeling that the inside of my brain was on fire, it didn't hurt, but it felt like my skull was under immense pressure from the inside… I saw people running across the room, things in the ceiling, small people, all sorts of weird and scary things” [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=43071).
