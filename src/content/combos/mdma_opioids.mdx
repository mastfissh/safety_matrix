title: MDMA + Opioids

## Experience reports

"the only opioid that would have serious interactions with mdma and should be avoided regardless of the dose is tramadol. but mdma also inhibits the enzyme cyp2d6, which metabolises some opioids. so some adjustment of the dose might be advisable if you're taking one of those." [Bluelight] (https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/mdma-and-opiates.767683/).

"generally a safe combo, however oxycodone will blunt the MDMA euphoria. I would save the oxy for the comedown of MDMA, that would be the best way to combine them IMO." [Bluelight] (https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/mdma-oxycodone.924174/).
