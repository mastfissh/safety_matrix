## Experience reports

“my mindset rapidly changed from the dream-like buzz of the LSA to one that was extremely awake and euphoric. This was a recognizable ‘come up’ of mushrooms, but I felt that the LSA made the come up much more smooth and tactile than usual, that is, without the usual feelings of slight anxiety and confusion” [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=35286).

“The trip is still escalating, my visual field is covered in tracers, my mind is going insane, I’m shivering and my heart-rate is through the roof.” [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=114719).
