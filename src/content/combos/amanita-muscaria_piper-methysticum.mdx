## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

“The mushrooms were very intense indeed but only on a mental level. Absolutely no visual or audio hallucinations. Although I will say there was a very intense sensation waving through my body which I cannot describe but found to be pleasant.” [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=58843).

“We believed that we could talk fine, and think fine, we had converstations, but our bodies were totally detached, and seemed to be doing their own thing. I would like to note that this feeling was not unpleasant at all and it was really enjoyable.” [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=43893).
