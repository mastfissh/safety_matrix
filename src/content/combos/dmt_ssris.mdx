title: DMT + SSRIs

## Experience reports

"I'd say that DMT is too potent for SNRI related receptor downregulation to reach trip-stopping intensity but you might require higher than usual dosages. At least my experiences are that S/NRI (venlafaxine 150mg in me) completely destroy shrooms but on the same dosage I got normal dose-to-effects ratio from 1cP-LSD, it took some time for the effects to set in but that's nothing special, and then I got absolutely beautiful visuals."
