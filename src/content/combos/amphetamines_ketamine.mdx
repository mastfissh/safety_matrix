## Experience reports

“speed may detract from the kets effects a little.” [Bluelight] (https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/ketamine-and-amphetamines-speed.680059/).

“when I dose some ketamine (20mg will do the trick, I have done larger amounts as well, up to 150mg of the s isomer) a few hours into the tweak experience: First I will experience regular ketamine effects, when this wears off I will get a huge increase in energy, just like I had done another dose of amphetamine. This "boost" will last not only until the amp should have worn off, but far longer. By experience (5 trials so far) it will be very easy to stay up for 48 hours without redosing neither amphetamine nor ketamine!!!” [Bluelight] (https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/the-ketamine-nmda-na-mg-and-amphetamine-interaction-thread.335877/).
