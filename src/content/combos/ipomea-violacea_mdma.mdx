## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

"No nervousness or emotional edginess was encountered due to the MDMA and the euphoria it produced which thankfully blocked out all the bad vibes on receives when experiencing the common trip. Visuals were rather intense and strikingly similar to that of a strong dose of mushrooms" [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=32864).
