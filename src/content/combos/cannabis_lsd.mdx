## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

"It will make the visuals more pronounced but it can add anxiety if you do not smoke a lot or get anxiety from marijuana easily. For someone who smokes a lot, it can help calm them down and is very enjoyable. If you smoke a lot of weed usually, you would probably like to smoke while on LSD but if you don't then I would advise against it, unless your trip is not strong/substantial enough for you."

"At midnight I got home from going out to eat with my friends, and I was looking for a quick way to get to sleep so I smoked two bowls. My intentions were to see what it was like smoking while on LSD, and then fall promptly to sleep. That was definitely not what happened...  I opened my eyes to my dark room, and I couldn't make out what was in front of my face. The visuals had turned into a full-screen movie that played over and over as I tried to focus on my surroundings. I saw people from my past doing things that I had seen them do, random tasks, but they wouldn't stop and I began to get afraid" [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=5100).
