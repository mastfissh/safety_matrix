## Experience reports

“5 minutes after sniffing two large lines, I felt a wave of euphoria and my head cleared. I felt alert and happy. My motor skills improved and I was able to successfully mix another drink. My rate of drinking slowed as I did not feel the need for alcohol as strongly after a line of coke.” [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=76040).

“my heart is racing and pounding in my ears, and I'm beginning to feel anxiety welling up in my chest. I tell myself to chill out and slam a giant crown and coke and I feel much better… My body feels tingly all over, like its zinging with energy.” [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=45610).
