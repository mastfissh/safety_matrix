## Experience reports

“…I was awe struck @ how magnificent and different I felt –words fail to describe it. I was conscious only for a short time and realized I was completely hunched over and almost falling out of my desk chair and being pulled into this realm of silvery light. I thought it would be a good idea to get to my bed, but never made it… I cannot make sense or remember anything else until 8am.” [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=69989).

“I felt like I had been poisoned. I vomited several times and had impaired motor skills. B and I both were sweating profusely- as in, 'having to change your clothes several times' profusely. I took two showers and had to sit in a hot bath because I was nearly hypothermic, but still sweating uncontrollably.” [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=76775).
