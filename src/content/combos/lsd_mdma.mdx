## Experience reports

"The chemicals have a definite synergy (the closed-eye visuals while holding onto someone and listening to music are insane, and the world is SO beautiful), but the acid can be overpowered, so make sure to get your doses right. And as for the timing, if you've been peaking on the acid for an hour or two, the rush from the e is amazing. Every weight in your mind and body lifts off you, trees seem to bloom spontaneously" [Bluelight] (https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/combo-thread-lsd-mdma-the-candyflip.220721/page-2).

"I felt empty in the most beautiful way. I meditated on the importance of love and on how much I love my friends. Also, MDMA brought to the surface repressed negative baggage that I had been carrying around." [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=107255).
