## Experience reports

"For an hour I am stuck in circular thought where I realize with a sigh that I am stuck in circular reasoning." [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=96085).

"After the first initial purge, everything around me changed. While it stayed the same. Books were independently moving on shelves, the floor seemed to be the saddest part of the room ... I was re-born. I knew precisely when the last bit of whatever dark mix was inside me found itâ€™s way out and boy what a feeling that was! I felt the most uplifting sensation, the sensation that cons probably get when being released from prison. I felt that a piece of my soul had cancer, and that cancer was destroyed faster than my ability to fully comprehend what was going on" [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=98280).
