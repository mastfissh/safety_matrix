## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

“I step into the shower just as a huge energy rush hits and I look down at the shower floor not quite sure if I’m enjoying this or not. This is the heaviest body load I’ve ever felt on a psychedelic. The walls of the shower are made of earth-tone tiles with white grout in between, making a contrasting grid pattern I’d never seen so sharply. I can’t stare for too long, it’s almost too much.” [Erowid](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=30604).
“I found that while I wanted to both puke and poop I could not easily do either… When I washed my hands the water in the sink bubbled as it when down the drain, the tiles warped and swirled, and my exit was hard to realize as the hallways bent. My mind was becoming more and more clouded and I almost didn’t make it out. Eventually I did and I reunited with my friends and we journeyed onward towards the lake. My visuals were very intense by now and I was having trouble communicating.” [Erowid](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=94130).
