## Experience reports

"Whole body buzzing, legs feel light. Lights flickering, eyes wobbling everything is beautiful... rub my face and neck, jaw clenching and grinding, caught in the moment of one of the best feelings ever. [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=81661).

"I had no hangover from the alcohol but had a very bad stomach and proceeded to vomit several times over a few hours. ... Mixing Mephedrone with alcohol was a very bad idea I experienced a great deal of memory loss and this is not something that usually happens to me and the nausea of today is unbearable" [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=76757).
