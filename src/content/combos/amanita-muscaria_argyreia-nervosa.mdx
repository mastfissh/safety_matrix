## Experience reports

“I go to the bathroom and wretch… Then I feel very weak, but a lot better…
From here the worst effects end, and I slowly just shake slightly, and find it hard to type or walk. My mind feels broken and I feel like I am slowly dying. My heart beats incredibly fast for hours…” [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=62950).

“it seems I was just mindlessly muttering things into the recorder the entire night. I felt a bit tired, and super-comfortable on the bed underneath the 'paper blankets', but the No-Doz we'd taken earlier would keep me awake. By about 5am, I was seeing spiral staircases everywhere, endlessly twirling and sinking into the bed and floor. And even weirder, I started having hallucinations that the others were having hallucinations of me!” [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=52240).
