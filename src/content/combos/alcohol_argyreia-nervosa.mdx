## Experience reports

“feeling slightly nauseous, as expected: a sickening sensation is creeping down into my arms, not unlike when I’m about to faint. Wavering between going to the bathroom and staying in my chair waiting it out. Feeling very depersonalised, as though I’m just a pair of eyes rather than a subjective individual.” [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=65221).

“I think the nausea was probably heightened by the poor removal of material and my heavy drunkenness” [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=69450).
