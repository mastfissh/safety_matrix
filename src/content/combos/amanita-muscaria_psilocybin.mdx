## Experience reports

“I am totally out of this world. I can hardly recognise my friends. Their faces are expanding like air balloons, some being hilarious and some being scary… It felt like I can smell the different colors. Nothing made sense. Objects were talking to me. Voices were having conversations in my mind and I was just listening to them.” [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=42000).

“I felt a strange combination of states: intellectually alert enough to write this report in spite of not having had enough sleep, introspective and quiet, my senses were heightened but my emotions were dulled (so although music, lights, pictures all seemed more intense, they didn't evoke any particular feelings in me).” [Erowid] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=75947).
