## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

“As a result of excessive alcohol use beforehand (and subsequent excessive ecstasy use), what was supposed to be a really enjoyable night with my mates turned into something I can't remember in the slightest, and a lot of mouth pain for the next week.” [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=42372).

“the alcohol overpowered the smooth ecstasy feeling and me and J decided to take more. For some reason, I had a feeling that it was the fox pill that made me feel so good and I decided to take another 1/4 . It took about 45 minutes to kick in. By then, I didn't feel the alcohol…” [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=71575).
