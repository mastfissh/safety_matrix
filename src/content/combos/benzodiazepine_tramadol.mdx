## Experience reports
"I prefer* to take benzos and tramadol separately. This way I can experience the tram to the fullest. Same goes for the benzos. That all being said, sometimes it is nice/decently enjoyable to mix the two in reasonable amounts to produce a 'smoother' feeling" [Bluelight] (https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/tramadol-and-xanax.651268/).

"It's real important that you stick to your normal dose of Tramadol. The valium can make you feel like you can take more Tramadol then your suppose to." [Bluelight] (https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/is-diazepam-and-tramadol-a-good-combo.764890/).
