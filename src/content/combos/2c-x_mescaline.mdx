## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

“2C-B made the combination feel less gentle than doing mescaline alone, and mixing the two made it feel less clear-headed than doing either one alone. It was still very easy to control the direction of the high, however. 2C-B added a better body high, and more insight, but it took a lot away from the mescaline.” [Bluelight](https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/mescaline-and-2c-b.696395/).
