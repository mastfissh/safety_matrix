## Experience reports

“I've combined mushrooms and 2C-B before and they certainly didn't play nice that time, like they were trying to work in a different mode or on a different level and it tugged on me and was pretty confusion. My best friend tried it some other time and had wonderful results, so clearly mileages vary a lot with this one…” [Bluelight](https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/combo-subthread-2c-b-tryptamines.398833/page-2).
“I did it in a club and was dancing like a nutter for a while. I was concerned at some points about being too wasted but the 2cb seemed to keep the mushrooms in check and gave it a nice positive push.” [Bluelight](https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/combo-subthread-2c-b-tryptamines.398833/page-4).
