## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

"I find the synergy to be rather nice actually. Ive taken morphine, hydromorphone, oxycodone and codeine with shrooms before and oxy didnt dull the visuals any for me. I found the overlapping euphoria of both drugs to be pretty nice actually. However if you get nauseous on either it could turn into a puke fest."
