## Reports of people trying this psychoactive combination

“…too lost in our respective worlds to talk, my closed eye world is once again a colorful space of geometry, while the open eyed space collapses to a 2D pastelscape, with the shifting RGB lights I have installed making the colors somehow jump in waves from the smoothly shifting light. The candygore dragon painting I have on my wall refuses to make any sense, being a vivid window into a world of impossible shapes and delicious colors.” [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=116279).
