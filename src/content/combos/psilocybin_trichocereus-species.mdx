## Experience reports

"I feel deeper and deeper into a world of color and architecture. I remember stepping into a city I cannot even begin to describe when the experience overtook me. I had apperently fallen asleep but I was still in the middle of my visions. Upon waking my visuals were so intense for a brief moment I could not tell the edges of reality from the visuals."
