## Experience reports

"...I began to smoke some high quality Cannabis out of my glass pipe... the two substances had actually complemented each other very nicely. I had completely forgotten about the hydrocodone I had taken, but now I realized that the wonderful, floaty feeling of the hydrocodone had taken the sometimes annoying body load away from the stoned feeling. I felt wonderfully high for quite a while, seeming as light as a feather... I am very experienced with cannabis, and I am no beginner with pharmeceuticals, but together, these substances are definitely very enjoyable..." [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=5742).


"...I would lower the dosage of each drug, not so much because it is dangerous otherwise but just because I find that when I mix with weed with opiates I don't need as much opiates to feel good..." [Bluelight](https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/marijuana-and-hydromorphone-safe.776089/).
